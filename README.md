## Overview

The AJS Interpreter is a custom fork of JavaScript, built as part of a university project to gain deeper insights into programming language implementation. By re-creating key aspects of JavaScript in Racket, the project serves as both a learning tool and a foundation for experimenting with interpreter design.

## Features

- **Custom JavaScript Fork:** Implements a subset of JavaScript functionalities tailored for educational purposes.
- **Lightweight Interpreter:** Efficiently executes scripts written in the custom JavaScript dialect.
- **Educational Resource:** Offers insights into the core components of interpreters such as lexing, parsing, and evaluation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) – Ensure you have the latest version installed.

### Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/knull-reaper/ajs_interpreter.git
```

Then, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd ajs_interpreter
```

## Usage

Run the interpreter by executing the main script with Racket. Assuming the main entry point is located in the `src` folder, you can start the interpreter with:

```bash
racket src/main.rkt
```

If your interpreter supports running a script file as an argument, you might use:

```bash
racket src/main.rkt path/to/your_script.ajs
```

### Example

Create a simple script file, for instance `example.ajs`, with the following content:

```javascript
// example.ajs
print("Hello, AJS Interpreter!");
```

Then run the interpreter to execute the script:

```bash
racket src/main.rkt example.ajs
```

## Project Structure

A suggested layout for the project is:

```
ajs_interpreter/
├── src/
│   ├── main.rkt         # Main entry point for the interpreter
│   ├── lexer.rkt        # Module for lexical analysis
│   ├── parser.rkt       # Module for parsing tokens into an AST
│   ├── interpreter.rkt  # Module for executing the AST
│   └── ...              # Additional modules and utilities
├── .gitignore           # Files and directories to ignore
└── README.md            # Project documentation
```

Adjust the structure as needed based on your actual file layout.
